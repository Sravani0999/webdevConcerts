<b><u>About the Event</u></b>
Sunburn, Asia’s biggest electronic dance music festival kicked off Season 14 with the launch
 of ‘Sunburn @ Home’, a brand new Live Streaming venture, specially curated to reach out to
 millions of Sunburn Fans with an objective of encouraging the ‘Social Distancing’ and compulsory
 lockdown mandate enforced by governments around the world and across India in the wake of the
 COVID-19 crisis.
The ‘Sunburn @ Home’ Live Stream will feature an eclectic mix of trending international
and domestic talents in the EDM domain. Given the #National Lockdown and #SocialDistancing
enforced mandate which led to many sources of on-ground live entertainment options being instantaneously
 cancelled pan India, the ‘Sunburn @ Home’ Live Stream came as a welcome surprise and great
 entertainment alternative for Sunburn Fans and music aficionados over the weekend.
